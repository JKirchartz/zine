# T I L D E  T O W N  Z I N E

hello.

this is the zine for tilde.town. we release irregularly and accept contributions from absolutely everyone.

to sign up please visit [this page](https://cgi.tilde.town/users/signup). we would love it if you joined.

# current status

we are currently accepting contributions for issue 3! everything very welcome.

# when is a new issue released?

a new issue is released whenever we feel we have enough content.

(We're aiming for December 2018 for Issue 3, but we may not make it.)

# how do I get a copy?

every issue should have a `.pdf` in the folder which you can use to print out and make your own version! ~jumblesale, ~insom, and ~joe have also been sending out versions. if you'd like one, just put your address in a ~/.address file (if on tilde.town) or reach out to them on twitter/[mastodon](http://tiny.tilde.website) and they will do their best to send one out.
