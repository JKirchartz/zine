# T I L D E  T O W N  Z I N E

hello.

this is the zine for tilde.town. we try (and fail miserably) to release regularly and accept contributions from absolutely everyone.

to sign up please visit [this page](https://cgi.tilde.town/users/signup). we would love it if you joined.

# current status

we are currently accepting contributions for issue 3! everything very welcome.

# when is a new issue released?

starting with issue 3, we have a release window every 3 months. if we think we need more for the issue, we leave it open until the next window. whenever an issue is finished, we immediately open the next issue and work on getting the copy out. (see [here] for the planned release schedule)

# how do I get a copy?

every issue should have a `.pdf` in the folder which you can use to print out and make your own version! ~jumblesale, ~insom, and ~joe have also been sending out versions. if you'd like one, just put your address in a ~/.address file (if on tilde.town) or reach out to them on twitter/[mastodon](http://tiny.tilde.website) and they will do their best to send one out.
