# current status

we are currently accepting contributions for issue 3! everything very welcome.

# how do I get a copy?

every issue should have a `.pdf` in the folder which you can use to print out and make your own version! ~jumblesale has also been sending out versions. if you'd like one, just drop him your address on alpine, irc or twitter and he will do his best to send one out.
