Yeah, well, I made the game, so I cheated the rules a bit. Sue me. (please don't actually!)
## How can I sign up?

However, in order to play, you must have a tilde.town account. See tilde.town to sign up for an account.
## I don't have a tilde.town account, but I want to see how this turns out!
There is a spreadsheet with all of the game info on it that will be linked on the aforementioned page when the game is going.
