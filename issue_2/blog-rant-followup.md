I guess I have to make another one of these so...

# BLOG RANT 2: THE FOLLOWUP

So, inbetween the previous Blog Rant and this one, TTBP came out. TTBP is a blogging platform made by ~endorphant, and it was meant to solve the issues with
blogging on tildes. However, it felt closed down. It started out well, but it slowly started to feel constricting, like being shut in a closet. Now don't get me wrong,
TTBP is a good thing, but it's just not necessarily my thing. I started off using it, but in the end, I decided to make my own blog generator. My blog generator<sup>[ [1] ](https://github.com/MineRobber9000/blog-gen)</sup>,
which started out as a mess of spaghetti masquerading as code, was eventually cleaned up enough for me to release to GitHub. Now it has stuff like tweetlinks.

So, basically, although TTBP is good, it feels closed.

Sincerely,
	~minerobber
