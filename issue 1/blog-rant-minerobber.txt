This is my rant on the lack of blogging software for the command line.

----

Why is there little to no blogging software for the command line? It makes having a blog on tilde sites like tilde.town really hard, as you
have to either code the software yourself, or use a solution that really isn't meant for blogging (a perfect example of this would be my site
"The Gem Corner", which uses the Makefile and theme of the wiki, minus the date generated.) I believe that one burden of tildes is the difficulty
of making a cool website, which is complicated enough by the lack of PHP. A way to remedy this would be the creation of some easy-to-use, ready-made
program to use for blogging. Being able to organize thoughts is a wonderful thing, but not being able to do it easily is a problem.
