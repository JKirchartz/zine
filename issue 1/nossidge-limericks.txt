bad pun / filthy limericks
by nossidge

Young Ronald had never quite gotten
The hang of all things wool and cotton.
One day in Home Ec.
He cried out "Oh heck!
I soon shall be knitting a knot in!"

There was an old man who, when sleeping,
Could not stop his cock from secreting.
His nocturnal emission
Had such power and precision
It plastered the cracks in the ceiling.

The corporal had zero qualms
About bringing civilians to harm.
But his quick IED
Was too quick for he,
And now he has guns, but no arms.

Your girl is a sight most exquisite,
Though forgive me for being explicit:
It's true what you said,
Your daughter turns heads
But mostly, I've found, she just gives it.

Katie, though kind and subdued,
Often carried an axe on the Tube.
If a man dared to spread,
She would cut off his legs,
"It's just fitting for someone so rude."

When the menopause hit Gloriana,
She found she longer had time for
Downton Abbey, Jane Eyre,
Vanity Fair,
Or any such period drama.

When Johnny would joke and distract,
Mrs. Smith put a stop to it fast.
"On your knees, boy!" she said,
Then she opened her legs,
And now he's the head of the class.

Beethoven, though late of cirrhosis,
Was too lost in music to notice.
Ignoring the tomb
His work was resumed
And he now, decomposing, composes.
