Made this ...some... years ago for a project that never really materialized.

Was supposed to be a 'mini-command-ship' in a Homeworld-like game (space RTS).

I.e. a small inexpensive capital ship that could service/repair/build even smaller ships (fighters, corvettes, resourcers...) and would act as a flag ship/home base for a group of such ships.
