The 80s cybernaut dreamed of assuming whatever shape suited them while soaring
through neon clouds stretched infinitely over the matte black of pure thought
and the faint grids of inter-connected servers.  As computers became more
powerful and displays more capable, this dream became inverted: we did not
visualize neon fields, but instead have found ourselves interfacing with
cyberspace on a series of bureaucratic web forms designed and provided by
massive corporations. Though very different in aesthetic and interface, we have
realized the libertarian dystopias envisioned in the cyberpunk literature of
the late 20th century.

Despite this, cyberspace remains an intoxicating place. Humans have a hard time
resisting perpetual connectivity to a world that, at times, feels even more real
than the air and meat surrounding us offline. Regardless of who you are,
cyberspace promises something for you. We are all seekers, hunting online for
that which fulfills us and which all too often is lacking in the world of the
flesh.

tilde.town, at first glance, may seem like an exercise in pure cybernostalgia
or a sort of reactionary luddism. Neither extreme is accurate. The town's
mission is to look backwards at a period of time when the promise of cyberspace
was fluidity and user-empowerment while, at the same time, looking forward at
technologies that help us adminster shared systems cheaply and easily. Through
this duality, tilde.town aims to be a community focused on the safe expression
of identity, the creation of digital art, and peer education.

So, how is tilde.town doing?(1) The town has existed for 17 months. There have
been nearly 600 signups, of which 353 led to updated homepages. Anecdotally,
there is an average 12-20 active connections to the serve each day and most of
those users engage in daily IRC chat. The following is a sort of informal
report card on the goals of the town and discussion on future changes.

=== F- === The Tilde Constellation

A part of the original tilde dream was an interconnected series of
servers, all with micro-communities, that could communicate over media like IRC
and Usenet. In the beginning, a Usenet connection was established between
tilde.club and tilde.town. No other tildes were ever added and after the first
many months of the tildes' existence, usenet had gone dark. Work was done
towards bridging the IRC gaps between club and town, but that work went
unfinished.

Many tilde servers have become inactive. tilde.town is (as far as I know) the
most active tilde server around. However, there are definitely other
communities humming along. We should reach out to them and establish whatever
links we're comfortable establishing.

=== A === Artistic Projects

We've seen incredible writing(2), HTML art(3), sound art(4) and all around
lovely creativity from so many members of the town. We even have a MUD.
tilde.town is an incredibly creative place.

The only thing between the A and the A+ is more curation and promotion of the
works we produce as a community. We're making lovely things and the world
should know! This zine is a wonderful step in that direction.

=== A+ === The Feels

The defining characteristic of tilde.town (at least, in my mind) is
its concern with maintaining a safe space where people are comfortable being
vulnerable. Our IRC has been graced with countless open and meaningful
conversations between members. Friendships are being made across huge temporal
and physical distances and it's extremely heart warming.

Keep up the good feels.

=== C === Peer Education

It's been 17 months and I've hardly spent time documenting tilde.town. We have
a strange wiki(5) but, after several awesome bursts of activity, it's stayed
mostly untouched.

As a community, though, we're always willing and happy to help new people and
answer questions. Moving forward, establishing a better framework for learning
materials will let us channel that new user friendliness into more usable
documentation. I'm open to something like a proper mediawiki(6).

tilde.town should be a place where people can come learn useful and broadly
applicable terminal, coding, and systems administration skills.

=== D === Accessibility

The barrier to entry for tilde.town is too high: even with great documentation,
SSH is an incredibly new and strange concept for most people. If we really want
to open up the town to everyone, we need to make a few things easier:

    1) signing up
    2) logging in
    3) editing html
    4) activity awareness

For 1, the plan is to create a web page that can generate RSA keys in browser
(keeping the private key only on the client). This means we can control the
most confusingand platform dependent part of signing up, making it easier for
new people.

For 2, given that users use our signup tool, we can provide a little script
(per platform) that starts up putty/ssh appropriately and uses the right key.

For 3, we should develop a baseline config for either nano or emacs and then
thoroughly document how to use them.

For 4, it's become apparent that, when IRC is quiet, the town seems abandoned.
It's hard to tell when people are around making stuff or looking to communicate
but just not on IRC (real time chat isn't for everyone). To this end, we should
create a custom bash prompt for users that has information about unread local
mail messages(7) and online users as well as better integration with presence
tools like "who".

tilde.town is something special. We're taking back technology that was
originally intended to connect humans but was subverted for commercial and
surveillance ends. We're learning from each other and helping to show the world
that computers aren't just for profit and making each other feel bad. 

Here's to the next 17 months~

    given at Clojure/west 2016 by Claire Alvis: https://youtu.be/cO67QNn9hPY
(2) There are examples all over the town, but I most recently was delighted by
    ~insom's "Puking I have Known #1"
(3) ~joe's page continues to inspire and astonish viewers.
