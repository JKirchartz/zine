Canary Wharf has become unmoored.

One bright Tuesday morning it slipped its tethers and set off down the Thames.

Pleasure cruises stopped to watch with idle amusement as it wrenched itself free of the docklands and started its slow journey east.

Passengers on tube trains departing Canda Water were told they would no longer be stopping at Canary Wharf as the station was now half-way to Woolwich. This was no small source of consternation for commuters: many of them would go on to be late for work.

Bridges uprooted themselves to make way for the liberated isle as it passed serenely by. This was, after all, natural and inevitable; like the migration of birds, so too must this financial district eventually depart the city.

The newly-minted citizens had had everything they needed for a long time now. There were many highly profitable banks, their own private police force and as many as four Prets. They even had a sports bar. The only mystery remaining on the minds of the London residents left behind was: why not sooner?

Tower Bridge saluted its departure as it floated by underneath and then it was free. Fish played merrily amongst the foundations of the great glass-steel monoliths as it left the shores of Kent and slipped into the Channel.

That evening abandoned families in Haggerston and Clapham, Hoxton and Greenwich huddled around their TV sets to watch news helicopters buzz around the spires like a crowd of gnats. 'It's ok,' They whispered to one another, 'They're somewhere better now. Somewhere with lower taxes.'

You can still visit there today. Flights from City Airport to Canary Wharf International are cheap and frequent. A twin-prop takes you thirty minutes out east, out past Bristol and Lundy, and onto a pontoon runway attached to the isle itself.

Like an ill-weathered Gibraltar it sits as an outpost of Britishness amongst the blank blue waters of the Atlantic. Unlike Gibraltar there's plenty to do during a visit: try to order a cup of tea in a local cafe using the International Language of Business (a dialect of English); watch the locals going to and from work in their traditional dress (shirt and slacks); or just relax in the municipal park. For two hours a day the sun crests the great towers of HSBC and Citi and casts warmth onto the little square of grass at the centre of the nation.

You can sit and think about what tethers us to the fabric of our society and whether not all of us should jettison our connections and become an island in the Atlantic. Free from debt or responsibility to the communities which foster us. What do we truly owe to any instution who won't grant us complete financial independence? If the role of the establishment is to share achievement with the undeserving then there is no way for a developed financial district to be content within that establishment. Eventually all of us, like Canary Wharf, must wrench ourselves free if we have the ambition to achieve our potential.

Canary Wharf has become unmoored.
