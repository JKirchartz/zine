Hi!  This is townzine, my very first original composition!

It was made in MONOTONE, the PC speaker tracker.  Why MONOTONE?  Since I'm
learning to do music, I figured I'd start with something very trivial so I
don't get overwhelmed.  The PC speaker is nothing but a square wave - no
pulse width modulation, no volume controls, no stereo, nothing.  It's the
most trivial instrument there is.

How was this done?  Mostly trial and error.  For some parts I tried humming
the note I wanted into a pitch detector, but in the end I had to try several
notes to see which one fits the most anyway.

I tried a few different things in this song.  Of course it's not very good,
but one has to start somewhere.

What I'd like to focus on next time:
- Pick a musical scale and stick with it, instead of guessing
- Try to include more harmony.  I did some this time around, mostly full
   octaves though
- Make the song longer, but at the same time, stick with a central melody

Thanks for listening!
