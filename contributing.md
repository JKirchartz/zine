contributions are really welcome from anyone. the focus of the zine is prose / poetry / art / feelings / honesty so if you have anything that fits that criteria we would love to publish it so much.

To submit content to the zine:
 - navigate to the current issue ([here](https://github.com/tildetown/zine/tree/master/issue_2))
 - at the top of the screen is a white button which says "upload files"
 - upload the file you wanted to contribute
 - optionally give it a commit message
 - hit commit changes
 
 Or just create a PR with your page in whatever format in the directory for the current issue. We'll try to get it into the next print run.
