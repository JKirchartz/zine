# C O N T R I B U T I N G

contributions are really welcome from anyone. the focus of the zine is prose / poetry / art / feelings / honesty so if you have anything that fits that criteria we would love to publish it so much.

before you submit content, please make sure the layout of the issue hasn't been finalized. (if there is a layout.pages/layout.pdf in the issue dir, you're too late) if it's been finalized and you don't have perms to create a new folder, message a mod (@jumblesale, @minerobber to name a few) and we'll try to get you all set up.

To submit content to the zine:
 - navigate to the current issue ([here](https://github.com/tildetown/zine/tree/master/issue_3))
 - at the top of the screen is a white button which says "upload files"
 - upload the file you wanted to contribute
 - optionally give it a commit message
 - hit commit changes
 
 Or just create a PR with your page in whatever format in the directory for the current issue. We'll try to get it into the next print run.
